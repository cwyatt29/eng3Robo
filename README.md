# Engineering 3 DE Project 1 THE ROBOT ARM
Our robot arm is differnt than the traditional robotic arm. We will make a gantry/cartesain arm. We are doing this because we need the bot to lift a fair amount of weight.

## Phase_1,_Design

When designing our project we had two things in mind. The first was a scrap magnet, the magnet would be very important for picking up and dropping our metal objects. The second was a Shipping container crane, we were going to model our robot off of these cranes. Our goal was to pick up and transport metal objects, we would need both of these to acheive our goal.







## Phase_2,_Salvage

From our research we learned that the simplest way of creating an electro-magnet was to take a transformer out of a microwave and modify it, we go into more detail on how it works in  [Magnet assembly](##Magnet_assembly).
